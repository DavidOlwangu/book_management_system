# 📚 Book Management System

A simple **front-end Book Management System** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows a user (library patron) to enter book details, store them temporarily in memory, display the books on the page, and edit existing entries.

This project is suitable for beginners learning DOM manipulation and basic JavaScript logic.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Information Collection**: Fields for patron name, phone number, email, and ID.
- **Dynamic Book Listing**: Add books to a collection and see them appear instantly on the page without a reload.
- **Edit Functionality**: Clicking "Edit" populates the form with existing book data and removes the old entry, allowing for quick updates.
- **Form Validation**: Basic checks to ensure all fields are filled before a book is added.
- **Responsive Layout**: Uses a clean, structured fieldset design for easy navigation.
